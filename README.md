Compatibility

MuscleTrainer 1.0 supports ePSXe v.1.9.0 and psxfin v.1.13. No other versions will work. Do you run another emulator and want it to be supported in a future release? Please write a comment in the forum.

Installation

Extract and run the executable file inside the .zip file. MuscleTrainer can be started at any time, before or after the emulator is started. The trainer will auto-detect any running compatible emulators. The image file does not have to be mounted when starting.

Changing position

MuscleTrainer will continuously try to connect to any running emulators. Once connected, your emulator will be appear as black in the Emulator app list. The left column values will display the continuously updated values read from the game memory. The right column can be used to set a value of your choice. X, Y and Z refer to the length, width and height 3D coordinates used by the game to determine where on the map you are. Once done, push the Set button next to the box to set that value.

The map

When wandering around in The Natural World, your path will be painted on the map.
